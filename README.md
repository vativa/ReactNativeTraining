Yelp API Workarounds
In the upcoming lecture, we will be signing up for a Yelp developer account. Depending on your location, some students may be blocked from creating an account. There are a few things you can try.

Students noted a workaround in this thread using their phone which will show a captcha:

Using a VPN for registration and making API calls should also work. Students mentioned they were able to successfully sign up for an API key using the Opera Browser's built-in VPN feature. Other students mentioned that they were able to use Tunnelbear's free tier.

Lastly, you can try just using my key:

Note - If some students try to use this in production or abuse the key in some way, you will start getting 429 errors (too many requests). There is a strict 5000 call per day quota - please only use this key for this course and to complete this project.
